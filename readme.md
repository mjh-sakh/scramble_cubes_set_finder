# Background

Friend asked to help with the organization of a Christmas party for kids. They had a game in mind when two teams were competing by writing words associated with winter. Words should be written using cubes with a letter/char at each side. Task was to find a set of 10 cubes which would allow the maximum number of words.

First we generated a list of words for winter we can think about ourselves. Then we excluded some letters from the alphabet so they cannot write the most obvious curse words, as kids like to do punks :-) And then this code has been written to generate cube sets.

# How it works

First open python or c# code and add words you have in mind (one can have a random subset of dictionary or "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"). 

Then change your alphabet to whatever one you use. 

Start script and go party. 

Return several hours later after several millions combinations have been checked. Best combinations will be printed. Copy them to the jupyter notebook to pick the right set for you.

You can tune the number of cubes in a set. Make sure you alter max_letter_repetitions param too.
